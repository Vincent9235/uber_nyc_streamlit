## UBER NYC TRIP ANALYSIS ON STREAMLIT
This analysis was carried out on Uber couriers in New York in January 2015.
<br>
After data preparation, I use streamlit to plot differents graphs with matplotlib, seaborn or plotly. 
I also use folium package to plot maps.

I did this job during my courses at Efrei Paris. I also hope you find my job useful
